          <p>
            The cost of a BMW 6 Series can vary widely depending on the model year, trim level, optional features, and the condition of the vehicle (whether it's new or used). As of my last update in January 2022, the starting price for a new BMW 6 Series typically ranged from around $70,000 to over $120,000 USD. However, prices for used BMW 6 Series models can be significantly lower, depending on factors such as mileage, condition, and market demand.
            
            It's important to note that BMW frequently updates its lineup and introduces new models, so prices and availability may have changed since my last update. For the most accurate and up-to-date pricing information, I recommend visiting the official BMW website or contacting a BMW dealership. Additionally, consulting reputable automotive websites and resources can help you get an idea of the current market prices for new and used BMW 6 Series models.</p>
