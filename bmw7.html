            The horsepower of a BMW 7 Series sedan varies depending on the specific model, engine type, and any optional upgrades. As of my last update in January 2022, the BMW 7 Series typically offers a range of engines with varying power outputs. The entry-level models may have around 320 to 335 horsepower, while higher-performance variants, such as those equipped with turbocharged V8 or V12 engines, can offer significantly more power, often exceeding 500 horsepower.
            
            For the most accurate and up-to-date information on the horsepower of a specific BMW 7 Series model, it's best to consult the specifications provided by BMW for the particular model year and trim level you're interested in. These specifications can vary between model years and may also differ based on regional variations and optional packages.</p>
